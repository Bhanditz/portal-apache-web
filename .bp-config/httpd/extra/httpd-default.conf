# This is a host-specific config file for Apache. It depends on the existence of
# the environment variables `PORTAL_HOST`, `API_HOST`, `BOTTER_HOST` and
# `STYLEGUIDE_HOST`. These are the hostnames of the portal, API, botter, and
# styleguide, e.g.
#
#   PORTAL_HOST=p.blue.portal.europeana.eu
#   API_HOST=a.blue.portal.europeana.eu
#   BOTTER_HOST=b.blue.portal.europeana.eu
#   STYLEGUIDE_HOST=styleguide.europeana.eu

#
# All common apache include files should be copied from
# ~/common/apache to  .bp-config/httpd/extra
# before each cf push to ensure latest version is used!!
#
# Ideally as much as possible should be done in common files
# this file should only consist includes and lines with
# absolute url refs
