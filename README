======    .bp-config/httpd/extra

In this dir you store your apache
configs. The build pack defaults to the apache config found in 
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/tree/master/defaults/config/httpd/2.4.x/extra
For example, to override httpd-default.conf you would create a file
.bp-config/httpd/extra/httpd-default.conf
If you want to include an additional file, perhaps in
.bp-config/httpd/extra/httpd-default.conf include it as 
Include conf/extra/europeana.conf  and store it localy in
.bp-config/httpd/extra



====== htdocs

This is your webroot, files in this location will be served by this
apache
